        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>Iâ€™m a graphic design student from Cary,
          North Carolina. I am proficient in
          illustration, graphic design, and photo
          editing. I am known for my detailed and
          efficient work ethic. I always look forward
          to learning new skills, especially when it's
          creative!</p>

          <h3>Zenbee Beverage Campaign</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/Pasewicz-Pj4-Gif.gif" alt="zenbee campaign">
          <p>My prompt for this campaign was to create a beverage (either a soda or a beer) 
            for a set target audience of my choosing.</p>

          <h3>Isometric Cassette Advertisement</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/Pasewicz-TImockupBox.jpg" alt="Cassette Advertisement">
          <p>My prompt for this project was to create and exploded isometric view of a common household object.
             I wanted to create a whole branding for this design, because I thought an exploded isometric
             view of a cassette would work well as an engaging and visually interesting form of advertising material.</p>
