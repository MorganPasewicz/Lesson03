          <h2>Zenbee Beverage Campaign</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/Pasewicz-Pj4-Gif.gif" alt="zenbee campaign">
          <p>My prompt for this campaign was to create a beverage (either a soda or a beer) 
            for a set target audience of my choosing.</p>

          <h2>Mad Cowboy Chocolate Label Design</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/madcowboy.jpg" alt="MadCowboy">
          <p>My prompt was to create an American traditional tattoo-inspired design for a product of my choice, 
            and this is what I came up with.</p>

          <h2>Hilltop Apothecary Label Design</h3>
            <img src="placeholder images/hilltop.webp" alt="Hilltop Apothecary">
            <p>The prompt for this independent project is to design a logo for a wellness startup. 
              I decided I wanted to design a logo and packaging design for an essential oils wellness
               brand that was minimalist in its design but still stands out from other wellness brands. 
              It was challenging to try a minimalist design because, ordinarily, my designs are anything but.</p>

            <h2>Annual Report design Sunnyside Motel</h3>
              <img src="placeholder images/sunnyside.webp" alt="Sunnyside Motel">
              <p>For this project, I was tasked with making an annual report for the
                 company I came up with, Sunnyside Motel. Sunnyside Motel Is a luxury boutique hotel 
                 that has a 70s retro aesthetic: perfect for Instagram pictures or for anyone wanting a 
                 beautifully and uniquely decorated hotel room. It was difficult researching for this project, 
                 especially for accurate graphs and statistics to incorporate into the report. I also found it 
                 difficult to keep a consistent theme throughout the report. I decided to go with a heavily 
                 decorated report because it would match the brand identity of 
                Sunnyside Motel and would make it a bit more bearable to read all the way through.</p>

              <h2>Sodabunny Label Design</h3>
                <img src="placeholder images/sodabunny.webp" alt="Sodabunny Label design">
                <p>My prompt for this project was to create a label and web advertisments for a beverage brand.</p>

                <h2>Isometric Cassette Advertisement</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/Pasewicz-TImockupBox.jpg" alt="Cassette Advertisement">
          <p>My prompt for this project was to create and exploded isometric view of a common household object.
            I wanted to create a whole branding for this design, because I thought an exploded isometric
            view of a cassette would work well as an engaging and visually interesting form of advertising material.</p>
